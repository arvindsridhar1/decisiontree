Design Choices:
    -MyID3:
        - I used a variety of helper methods to guide my coding process in the writing of the ID3 algorithm

    -MyID3Test:
        -I had to edit the file path because my computer didn't recognize the shortData filepath given by the
        stencil code

Known Bugs:
    - None!

Handin:
    - This is my final handin

My Test Case Explanations:
    - simpleTest(): A test that just makes sure that there are no errors in getting a filepath for data
    - checkMaxAttribute(): Tests whether the calculateMaxInfoAttribute method works as intended
    - checkMostFrequentClassification(): Tests whether the findMostFrequentClassification method works as intended
    - checkDataEmpty(): Tests whether the checkDataEmpty method works as intended
    - checkAttributesEmpty(): Tests whether the checkAttibutesEmpty method works as intended
    - checkSameClassification(): Tests whether the sameClassificationCheck method works as intended
    - checkEntropy(): Tests whether the entropy calculation method works as intended
    - checkInformation(): Tests whether the information calculation method works as intended
    - checkNewDataInitializer(): Tests whether new data is properly initialized in the newDataInitializer method
    - testMaxInfoAttributeIndex(): Tests whether the maxInfoAttributeIndex method works as intended
